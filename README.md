# AStra Engine #
A Simple Rendering Engine.

It hosts majority of all the the features of a game engine. That will potentially be utilized in future project
indie games.

**Disclaimer:** This implementation follows various tutorials referenced below and is mainly a personal exercise
to learn about the involved api, pipelines, and algorithms. 

### Capabilities / Advantages ###
* Only Supports Wavefront file (.obj)
* Multi-texture and Atlas Texture Support
* Fog
* Terrains (Procedural, Heightmaps, Plane)
* Normal-Mapped and Parallax-Mapped Rendering
* Shadow Rendering
* Gui Rendering
* Text Rendering
* Particle Systems
* Skybox
* Post-Processing (Bloom, HDR, Gamma Correction, etc.)

### In Progress ###
- [ ] Deferred Shading
- [ ] Instanced Rendering
- [ ] Surface Simplification and Geomipmapping
- [ ] Gui Library
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Animation
- [ ] Dynamic Water Rendering
